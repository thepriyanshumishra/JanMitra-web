🏛 JANMITRA — FULL PROJECT SUMMARY (Website First)
1️⃣ Project Overview (High Level)

Project Name: JanMitra
Type: Accountability Infrastructure Platform
Platform First Build: Web App (Responsive → PWA → Mobile later)

JanMitra is NOT a normal complaint website.

It is a Governance Accountability System that makes institutional behavior visible, traceable, and measurable.

In simple words:

👉 Today complaints exist.
👉 But accountability does not.

JanMitra fixes that gap.

2️⃣ Core Problem We Are Solving
🚨 Current Reality of Government Complaint Systems

Existing portals focus on:

Submitting complaints

Routing complaints

Marking them resolved

But they do NOT show what happens in between.

And THAT is the real problem.

🔴 The Real Problem: Accountability Invisibility

When a complaint gets delayed or fails:

Citizens cannot see:

Where the complaint got stuck

Which department handled it

Who held it the longest

Why it was delayed

Whether this happens repeatedly

So even if systems exist, institutional behavior remains invisible.

⚠ What This Causes

Departments blame each other

SLAs exist but are never enforced

No memory of repeated failures

Same problems repeat every month

Citizens lose trust in governance

This is a structural governance problem, not just a tech problem.

3️⃣ Our Solution — JanMitra

JanMitra is an Accountability Infrastructure Platform.

Instead of just tracking complaints, we track:

👉 Flow of responsibility inside institutions.

We convert every complaint into institutional evidence.

4️⃣ Core Innovation — Responsibility Trace Engine

This is the heart of JanMitra.

Every complaint automatically generates a:

🔎 Responsibility Trace

It records:

When complaint was submitted

Which department received it

When officer acknowledged it

How long it stayed idle

When escalation happened

When proof was uploaded

When it was closed

So for the first time, we can answer:

Where did it stop?

Who held it?

Why was it delayed?

Has this happened before?

This is HUGE.

We move from complaint tracking → institutional behavior modeling.

5️⃣ Website-First Strategy (Very Important)

We decided to build:

1️⃣ Responsive Website
2️⃣ Convert to PWA later
3️⃣ Native mobile app later

Why website first?

Because JanMitra is:

Data heavy

Dashboard heavy

Analytics heavy

Used by officers/admins

Web is perfect for:

Graphs

Heatmaps

Analytics dashboards

Department performance pages

Mobile app will come later for citizens.
